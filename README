Poca is a command line podcast client, written in Python. Though started as a 
simple learning project script, it has grown to be a solid, capable program, 
that in the best *NIX tradition attemps to "do one thing and do it well".

Functionality-wise, the focus is - as the name hints at - to reign in its 
appetite: Subscribing to a feed should not simply downloading each new episode 
until the harddrive is groaning under the weight, rather it should mean having 
the latest episodes available while old ones are deleted. This is done by 
specifying the amount of disk space allocated to each feed.
 
As for user interface and design, Poca is intended to be a powerful and 
easy-to-use podcast tool (also in the *NIX spirit) rather than pre-molded 
podcast package. This leaves extensive options in the hands of the user, 
including id3 tagging, cronjob compatibility, error logging prefs, etc.

Installing
----------
 $ sudo ./setup.py install

Notes on install
----------------
setup.py is geared for install on POSIX environments. This means that the 
following assumptions are made as regards file placement:
 * An example configuration file is put in the '/etc' directory
 * The man page is put in 'share/man/man1', inside of the installation prefix
   (usually '/usr' or '/usr/local')
If this is unacceptable, please patch the setup.py file or contact the author.

Notes on dependencies
---------------------
* You will need to use Python2 (not Python3) for both setup and running the program.
* In order for XML parsing to work (elementTree), Python 2.5 or higher is required.
* The following third-party modules are required: feedparser, urlgrabber, eyeD3.
