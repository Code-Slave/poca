Poca consists of three parts:


* **poca**\ : an executable that downloads podcasts
* **poca-subscribe**\ : a tool to help organise and manage subscriptions
* **poca**\ : a Python library

``poca``\ , the executable, is simply run by typing in the command, once installed. See ``poca --help`` or ``man poca`` for a few straightforward parameters and flags or the `poca command <https://github.com/brokkr/poca/wiki/poca>`_ page. Most of the advanced features are accessed by way of the configuration file. Please see `Configuration <https://github.com/brokkr/poca/wiki/Configuration>`_ for details.

``poca-subscribe`` can help with managing subscriptions - adding, deleting and sorting - without having to edit the configuration file manually. Please see `poca-subscribe <https://github.com/brokkr/poca/wiki/poca-subscribe>`_ for details.
