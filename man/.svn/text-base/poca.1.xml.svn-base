<description>
<p><arg>Poca</arg> is a command line podcast client, written in Python. It attemps to "do one thing and do it well": Maintaing a number of podcast subscriptions in a user designated directory.</p>

<p>Functionality-wise, the focus is - as the name hints at - to reign in its appetite: Subscribing to a feed should not mean simply downloading each new episode until the harddrive is groaning under the weight; rather it should mean having the latest episodes available while old ones are automatically phased out. This is done by specifying the amount of disk space allocated to each feed.</p>

<options>
<option>
<p><opt>-h</opt>, <opt>--help</opt></p>
<optdesc><p>Show help message and exit.</p></optdesc>
</option>

<option>
<p><opt>-q</opt>, <opt>--quiet</opt></p>
<optdesc><p>Run in quiet mode. This turns off all printing to standard output which is useful when running the program as a cron job. Quiet mode does not conflict with using any of the error logging options (-m/-f).</p></optdesc>
</option>

<option>
<p><opt>-r</opt>, <opt>--restart</opt></p>
<optdesc><p>Restart the subscriptions. This will delete the log file (the 'history' of the subscriptions) and all downloaded content so the program can start over afresh. Not much need for it, but a 'last resort' if the log becomes damaged or if a large number of subscriptions have been removed from the subscriptions settings.</p></optdesc>
</option>

<option>
<p><opt>-f [<arg>errorsfile</arg>]</opt>, <opt>--errors-file [<arg>errorsfile</arg>]</opt></p>
<optdesc><p>Specify a file to use for error logging; if none are assigned the default, 'errors.log' in the .poca directory. is used.</p></optdesc>
</option>

<option>
<p><opt>-m</opt>, <opt>--errors-mail</opt></p>
<optdesc><p>Use the mail account setup in poca.xml to generate email error logging. One email will be sent per error encountered.</p></optdesc>
</option>

<section name = "Files">
<p><file>$HOME/.poca</file> is the user-specific configuration directory for <arg>Poca</arg>.</p>
<p><file>$HOME/.poca/poca.xml</file> is the configuration file. It is written in a custom XML format, designed to be fairly intuitive. The 'settings' section has options such as where to download the audio files and optional id3 tagging and email account options. The subscriptions section contains all the subscriptions, with info about the desired title, the drive space allocated to the subscription and optional id3 tags (for supplanting or supplementing that contained in the downloaded file). <br/>For more information on the configuration file, please see <url href="http://code.google.com/p/poca/wiki/Configuration"/>.</p>
<p><file>/etc/poca.example.xml</file> is the supplied example configuration file. Copy it to $HOME/.poca/poca.xml and edit it to suit your needs.</p>
<p><file>$HOME/.poca/history.log</file> is the program's memory. The program keeps track of what files it has seen before in order to quickly conclude which are new, which need to be downloaded, etc.</p>
<p><file>$HOME/.poca/errors.log</file> is the default error log file (plaintext). The program writes error messages to this file, if the -f switch is used and no alternative error log file is supplied by the user.</p>
